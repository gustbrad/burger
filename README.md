# Eat-Da-Burger Assignment

## Summary
This was an assignment that required the use of Node.js, MySQL, Express, and Express Handlebars with deployment to Heroku to create an app that has a database of burgers that are waiting to be devoured and burgers that have been devoured. You can then add new burgers and devour undevoured burgers.
